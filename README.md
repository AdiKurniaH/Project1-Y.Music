Y.Music is a music streaming platform that has data on listeners from various cities. In this project, we will compare the musical preferences of listeners in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. 
The main task of this project is to analyze and test several hypotheses and compare user behavior in the two cities.

# Hypothesis
1. User activity varies depending on the day and city.
2. On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville tune in to different genres. This also applies to Friday nights.
3. Listeners in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, users prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville rap music has more fans.

There are several stages that will be carried out in this project:
1. Data review
2. Data pre-processing
3. Hypothesis test
